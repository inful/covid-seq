## Preprocessing

### parallel-fastq-dump

Please see the [usage docs](https://github.com/nf-core/viralrecon/blob/master/docs/usage.md#supported-public-repository-ids) for a list of supported public repository identifiers and how to provide them to the pipeline. The final sample information for all identifiers is obtained from the ENA which provides direct download links for FastQ files as well as their associated md5sums. If a download link exists, the files will be downloaded by FTP otherwise they will be downloaded using [parallel-fastq-dump](https://github.com/rvalieris/parallel-fastq-dump).

</details>

### cat

If multiple libraries/runs have been provided for the same sample in the input samplesheet (e.g. to increase sequencing depth) then these will be merged at the very beginning of the pipeline in order to have consistent sample naming throughout the pipeline. Please refer to the [usage docs](https://github.com/nf-core/viralrecon/blob/dev/docs/usage.md#format) to see how to specify these samples in the input samplesheet.

### FastQC

[FastQC](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) gives general quality metrics about your sequenced reads. It provides information about the quality score distribution across your reads, per base sequence content (%A/T/G/C), adapter contamination and overrepresented sequences. For further reading and documentation see the [FastQC help pages](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/Help/).

### picard MarkDuplicates

Unless you are using [UMIs](https://emea.illumina.com/science/sequencing-method-explorer/kits-and-arrays/umi.html) it is not possible to establish whether the fragments you have sequenced from your sample were derived via true biological duplication (i.e. sequencing independent template fragments) or as a result of PCR biases introduced during the library preparation. By default, the pipeline uses picard MarkDuplicates to *mark* the duplicate reads identified amongst the alignments to allow you to guage the overall level of duplication in your samples. However, you can also choose to remove any reads identified as duplicates via the `--filter_dups` parameter.

### VarScan 2, BCFTools, BEDTools

[VarScan 2](http://dkoboldt.github.io/varscan/) is a platform-independent software tool to detect variants in NGS data. In this pipeline, VarScan 2 is used in conjunction with SAMtools in order to call both high and low frequency variants.

[BCFtools](http://samtools.github.io/bcftools/bcftools.html) is a set of utilities that manipulate variant calls in [VCF](https://vcftools.github.io/specs.html) and its binary counterpart BCF format. BCFTools is used in the variant calling and *de novo* assembly steps of this pipeline to obtain basic statistics from the VCF output. It is also used in the VarScan 2 variant calling branch of the pipeline to generate a consensus sequence by integrating high frequency variant calls into the reference genome.

[BEDTools](https://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a swiss-army knife of tools for a wide-range of genomics analysis tasks. In this pipeline we use `bedtools genomecov` to compute the per-base mapped read coverage in bedGraph format, and `bedtools maskfasta` to mask sequences in a Fasta file based on intervals defined in a feature file. This may be useful for creating your own masked genome file based on custom annotations or for masking all but your target regions when aligning sequence data from a targeted capture experiment.

### BCFTools and BEDTools

[BCFtools](http://samtools.github.io/bcftools/bcftools.html) can be used to call variants directly from BAM alignment files. The functionality to call variants with BCFTools in this pipeline was inspired by work carried out by [Conor Walker](https://github.com/conorwalker/covid19/blob/3cb26ec399417bedb7e60487415c78a405f517d6/scripts/call_variants.sh). In contrast to VarScan 2 and iVar, the original variant calls obtained by BCFTools are not filtered further by a higher allele frequency. It seems that the default calls obtained by BCFTools appear to be comparable with the high frequency variants generated by VarScan 2 and iVar.

The HTML results can be opened within any browser (we recommend using Google Chrome). Please see the [QUAST output docs](http://quast.sourceforge.net/docs/manual.html#sec3) for more detailed information regarding the output files.

<details markdown="1">
  <summary>Output files</summary>

* `variants/<CALLER>/quast/AF<MAX_ALLELE_FREQ>/`
    * `report.html`: Results report in HTML format. Also available in various other file formats i.e. `report.pdf`, `report.tex`, `report.tsv` and `report.txt`.

> **NB:** The value of `<CALLER>` in the output directory name above is determined by the `--callers` parameter (Default: 'varscan2,ivar,bcftools') and the value of `<MAX_ALLELE_FREQ>` is determined by the `--max_allele_freq` parameter (Default: 0.8).

### BCFTools isec

[BCFTools isec](http://samtools.github.io/bcftools/bcftools.html#isec) can be used to intersect the variant calls generated by the 3 different callers used in the pipeline. This permits a quick assessment of how consistently a particular variant is being called using different algorithms and to prioritise the investigation of the variants.

<details markdown="1">
  <summary>Output files</summary>

* `variants/intersect/<SAMPLE>/`
    * `*.vcf.gz`: VCF file containing variants common to at least 2/3 callers. There will be one file for each caller - see `README.txt` for details.
    * `*.vcf.gz.tbi`: Index for VCF file.
    * `README.txt`: File containing command used and file name mappings.
    * `sites.txt`: List of variants common to at least 2/3 callers in textual format. The last column indicates presence (1) or absence (0) amongst the 3 different callers.

</details>

## De novo assembly

A file called `summary_assembly_metrics_mqc.tsv` containing a selection of read and *de novo* assembly related metrics will be saved in the `assembly/` results directory. The same metrics have also been added to the top of the MultiQC report.

### Cutadapt

In the variant calling branch of the pipeline we are using [iVar trim](#ivar-trim) to remove primer sequences from the aligned BAM files for amplicon data. Since in the *de novo* assembly branch we don't align the reads, we use [Cutadapt](https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guide.html) as an alternative option to remove and clean the primer sequences directly from FastQ files.

<details markdown="1">
  <summary>Output files</summary>

### Kraken 2

[Kraken 2](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/kraken2/index.shtml?t=manual) is a sequence classifier that assigns taxonomic labels to DNA sequences. Kraken 2 examines the k-mers within a query sequence and uses the information within those k-mers to query a database. That database maps k-mers to the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of all genomes known to contain a given k-mer.

We used a Kraken 2 database in this workflow to filter out reads specific to the host genome. The remainder of the reads are then passed to numerous *de novo* assembly algorithms in order to reconstruct the viral genome.

<details markdown="1">
  <summary>Output files</summary>

* `assembly/kraken2/`
    * `*.host*.fastq.gz`: Reads that were classified to the host database.
    * `*.viral*.fastq.gz`: Reads that were unclassified to the host database.
    * `*.kraken2.report.txt`: Kraken 2 taxonomic report. See [here](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/kraken2/index.shtml?t=manual#sample-report-output-format) for a detailed description of the format.

## Workflow reporting and genomes

### MultiQC

[MultiQC](http://multiqc.info) is a visualization tool that generates a single HTML report summarizing all samples in your project. Most of the pipeline QC results are visualised in the report and further statistics are available in the report data directory.

Results generated by MultiQC collate pipeline QC from FastQC, fastp, Cutadapt, Bowtie 2, Kraken 2, VarScan 2, iVar, samtools flagstat, samtools idxstats, samtools stats, picard CollectMultipleMetrics and CollectWgsMetrics, BCFTools, SnpEff and QUAST.

The default [`multiqc config file`](https://github.com/nf-core/viralrecon/blob/master/assets/multiqc_config.yaml) has been written in a way in which to structure these QC metrics to make them more interpretable in the final report.

The pipeline has special steps which also allow the software versions to be reported in the MultiQC output for future traceability. For more information about how to use MultiQC reports, see <http://multiqc.info>.

Please click [here](https://raw.githack.com/nf-core/viralrecon/master/docs/html/multiqc_report.html) to see an example MultiQC report generated using the parameters defined in [this configuration file](https://github.com/nf-core/viralrecon/blob/master/conf/test_full.config) to run the pipeline on [samples](https://zenodo.org/record/3735111) which were prepared from the [ncov-2019 ARTIC Network V1 amplicon set](https://artic.network/ncov-2019) and sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform in 301bp paired-end format.

### Reference genome files

A number of genome-specific files are generated by the pipeline because they are required for the downstream processing of the results. If the `--save_reference` parameter is provided then the Bowtie 2 alignment indices, BLAST and Kraken 2 databases downloaded/generated by the pipeline will be saved in the `genome/` directory. It is recommended to use the `--save_reference` parameter if you are using the pipeline to build a Kraken 2 database for the host genome. This can be quite a time-consuming process and it permits their reuse for future runs of the pipeline or for other purposes.
